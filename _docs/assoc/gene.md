# Gene-based association analysis

This web page is under construction :-)

<!--- 

It is possible to use the LOCO estimates from LDAK-KVIK to perform more power-ful gene-based association analyses. An annotation file can be downloaded from the LDAK website:

```
wget xxxxxx
```

These can then be used to do

```
./ldak.out --cut-genes cut --gene-file genefile qqq
```

Afterwards, it is possible to run LDAK-GBAT-KVIK using
```
./ldak.out --calc-genes-reml gbat --bfile qwewqer --predictions kvik
```

Note that it is also possible to just run LDAK-GBAT by ignoring the term `--predictions kvik`.
