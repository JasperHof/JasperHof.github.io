# Downloading LDAK

LDAK can be downloaded from the [LDAK website](www.dougspeed.com/downloads2), or using these command lines in Linux:

```
wget https://dougspeed.com/wp-content/uploads/ldak5.2.linux_.zip
unzip ldak5.2.linux_
```

If compatible with your system, you should be able to see a list of options by running `./ldak5.2.linux`. If you do not have permission to run the file, then first run `chmod a+x ldak5.2.linux`.

**Please note** that it might be helpful to also sign up on the [LDAK mailing list](https://dougspeed.com/downloads). This mailing list will only be used to inform users of important updates, or upcoming workshops.
