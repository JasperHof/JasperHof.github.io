# Downloading LDAK

LDAK-KVIK is included in the LDAK software, that can be run on either a Linux-base PC or a Mac. LDAK can be downloaded from the [LDAK webpage](http://dougspeed.com/downloads2/). LDAK-KVIK can be installed in Linux using the command lines

```
wget https://dougspeed.com/wp-content/uploads/ldak5.2.linux_.zip
unzip ldak5.2.linux_
```

If compatible with your system, you should be able to see a list of options by running `./ldak5.2.linux`. If you do not have permission to run the file, then first run `chmod a+x ldak5.2.linux`.

**Please note** that it might be helpful to also sign up on the [LDAK mailing list](https://dougspeed.com/downloads). This mailing list will only be used to inform users of important updates, or upcoming workshops.
