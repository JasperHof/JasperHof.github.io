# Example code for running LDAK-KVIK

It is possible to run LDAK-KVIK directly on your own data, or to first try it out on simulated data. In case you wish to directly apply LDAK-KVIK to your own data, please jump to [Running LDAK-KVIK](#Running-LDAK-KVIK).

## Creating genotypes and phenotypes

Genotype data can be generated using the command line:
```
./ldak6.linux --make-snps data --num-samples 10000 --num-snps 50000
```
This generates the files `data.bed`, `data.bim` and `data.fam`, containing SNP data for 10000 individuals and 50000 genetic variants. The generated SNPs are evenly distributed across 22 chromosomes, with minor allele frequencies randomly sampled from the [0, 0.5] interval. Note that SNPs are generated in linkage equilibrium. The `--make-snps` command also generates the toy covariate file `data.covar`. 

Next, a quantitative phenotype can be generated using the command line:
```
./ldak6.linux --make-phenos pheno --bfile data --power -0.25 --her 0.5 --num-phenos 1 --num-causals 1000
```
This command generates one phenotype using the previously generated SNP data. The phenotype is simulated under a SNP heritability of 0.5, based on 1000 randomly selected causals SNPs. The power parameter is set to -0.25, indicating that common SNPs (with higher MAF) tend to explain more phenotypic variance (a phenomenon observed in human traits). SNP effect sizes are sampled from a normal distribution, and scaled to match the heritability.   

To generate binary phenotypes, the user should add a flag indicating the prevalence:
```
./ldak6.linux --make-phenos pheno --bfile data --power -0.25 --her 0.5 --num-phenos 1 --num-causals 1000 --prevalence 0.2
```
This will generate a phenotype data with 20% cases, and a liability heritability of 50%.

## Running LDAK-KVIK

An explanation of the input options of LDAK-KVIK can be found in the [LDAK-KVIK steps](/docs/assoc/singlesnp). Here, we demonstrate the basic command lines used to run LDAK-KVIK.

LDAK-KVIK is run in three steps. In Step 1, the Leave-One-Chromosome-Out (LOCO) PRS are computed using an Elastic Net model. Step 2 runs the single-SNP analysis, and Step 3 runs the gene-based associati√≤n analysis. These steps are consecutively run using the following commands:

```
./ldak6.linux --kvik-step1 kvik --bfile data --pheno pheno.pheno --covar data.covar --max-threads 4
./ldak6.linux --kvik-step2 kvik --bfile data --pheno pheno.pheno --covar data.covar --max-threads 4
./ldak6.linux --kvik-step3 kvik --bfile data --genefile <gene annotation file> --max-threads 4
```

In case a binary trait is analysed, the user should add the `--binary YES` flag in Step 1. Instructions for downloading the gene annotation file are described in the [gene-based analysis section](/docs/assoc/gene). An explanation of the generated output files is included in the [LDAK-KVIK output](/docs/output) page.
