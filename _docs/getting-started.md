# Downloading LDAK

LDAK can be downloaded from the [LDAK website](www.dougspeed.com/downloads2), or using these command lines in Linux:

```
---
wget www.dougspeed.com/downloads2/linuxversion
unzip zipfile
---
```

Then you can run  `ldak.out` to see a list of options. If you have done all this earlier, you can skip to the Single SNP section.
