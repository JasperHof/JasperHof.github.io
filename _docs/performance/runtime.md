## Computational Requirements

We compared the run time and memory requirements of LDAK-KVIK with Bolt-LMM and Regenie using data from 70k and 430k individuals from the UK Biobank. The computational costs were evaluated for two separate parts of the mixed-model association analysis: Step 1, in which the LOCO estimator is computed, and Step 2, in which the single-SNP analysis is performed.
